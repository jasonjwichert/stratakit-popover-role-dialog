## 0.3.0

### API changes

The following API changes apply to components exported from `@stratakit/mui`:

- [#1268](https://github.com/iTwin/stratakit/pull/1268): Added `render` prop to the `Root` component.
- [#1335](https://github.com/iTwin/stratakit/pull/1335): Added `rootNode` prop to the `Root` component.

The following API changes apply to components exported from `@mui/material`. Make sure to include `@stratakit/mui/types.d.ts` in your project to get the correct types.

- [#1212](https://github.com/iTwin/stratakit/pull/1212): Introduced a new `render` prop for all overrideable MUI components, replacing the previous `component` prop. The `render` prop is more flexible and aligns better with modern React patterns, while also allowing the StrataKit MUI theme to apply more powerful customizations.

  If you were previously using the `component` prop to override MUI components, you should now use the `render` prop instead. The `component` prop has been marked as deprecated.

  ```diff
  - <Typography component="h2">
  + <Typography render={<h2 />} />
  ```

  Note: Components that did not have a `component` prop previously will not have a `render` prop now.

- [#1321](https://github.com/iTwin/stratakit/pull/1321): Added a new `label` prop to `IconButton` and `ToggleButton`. When specified, the value of this prop will be used as the button's accessible name _and_ will also be shown in a tooltip when the button is hovered or focused.
- [#1287](https://github.com/iTwin/stratakit/pull/1287): Added a new `inline` prop to the `Badge` component to display the badge in normal document flow instead of positioned relative to its child.
- [#1252](https://github.com/iTwin/stratakit/pull/1252): Added a new `deleteLabel` prop to the `Chip` component for better localization.
- [#1259](https://github.com/iTwin/stratakit/pull/1259): ⚠️ Removed all values for the `size` prop from `Checkbox` and `Radio`.
- [#1288](https://github.com/iTwin/stratakit/pull/1288): ⚠️ Removed all values for the `color` prop from `Chip`.
- [#1294](https://github.com/iTwin/stratakit/pull/1294): ⚠️ Removed `"default"` value from `color` prop of `IconButton` component. The default color is now `"secondary"`.
- [#1332](https://github.com/iTwin/stratakit/pull/1332): ⚠️ Removed `LinkComponent` prop from `ButtonBase` (and therefore from all MUI components that extend it). Use the `render` prop instead.
- [#1287](https://github.com/iTwin/stratakit/pull/1287): ⚠️ Removed `"default"` value from `color` prop of `Badge` component. The default color is now `"secondary"`.

### Implementation changes

- [#1312](https://github.com/iTwin/stratakit/pull/1312): MUI styling engine changes:
  - Unnecessary vendor prefixes have been removed from the generated CSS using a custom Stylis plugin.
  - Emotion's `speedy` mode is enabled in both development and production. As a result, MUI styles are now injected directly into the CSSOM using `insertRule`.
  - Order of styles has been changed so that MUI styles are injected at the end of the `<head>` element, preventing issues where `@layer mui` would be added before other low-priority layers.
- [#1305](https://github.com/iTwin/stratakit/pull/1305): Removed [`role="region"`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/region_role) semantics from `Accordion` component.
- [#1269](https://github.com/iTwin/stratakit/pull/1269): `Card` will now be rendered as an `<article>` element by default. This should be used in combination with a heading inside the card. In cases where `CardHeader` is used, its `title` will be rendered as `<h2>` by default. In other cases, you can use the `Typography` component with `render` prop to specify the heading level.
- [#1274](https://github.com/iTwin/stratakit/pull/1274): `CardActionArea` has been redesigned to not wrap the entire card content. Instead, it should be used in the card's heading or title area. This improves the card's accessibility structure, while still allowing the entire card to be clickable.
- [#1252](https://github.com/iTwin/stratakit/pull/1252): Updated `Chip` component so the `root` element is no longer interactive. Deletable `Chip` now renders an interactive delete button, and clickable `Chip` renders its label as an interactive button.
- [#1298](https://github.com/iTwin/stratakit/pull/1298): Updated the default `variant` of `Typography` to `"body2"`.
- [#1296](https://github.com/iTwin/stratakit/pull/1296): Updated `Snackbar` to be rendered using a [portal](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/createPortal).
- [#1213](https://github.com/iTwin/stratakit/pull/1213): Changed `Autocomplete` to make the clear indicator focusable.
- [#1214](https://github.com/iTwin/stratakit/pull/1214): Updated `Autocomplete` to make the clear indicator visible without requiring user interaction.
