## StrataKit MUI modifications

- `Card` is rendered as an `<article>` element by default.
- `CardHeader`'s `title` is rendered as `<h2>` by default.
- `CardActionArea` will not have an unnecessary `role="button"` to avoid conflicting semantics when rendered as a link.

## Examples

### CardActions

::example{src="mui/Card.actions"}

### CardHeader

::example{src="mui/Card.header"}

## ✅ Do

- Use a heading element to provide a clear title for the card's content.

## 🚫 Don't

- Don't use a **Card** to group unrelated content or actions.
