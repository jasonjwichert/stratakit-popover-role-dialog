## StrataKit MUI modifications

- The `color` prop is not supported.
- The root element is no longer interactive. Instead, a deletable **Chip** now renders an interactive delete button, and a clickable **Chip** renders its label as an interactive button.
- Added a `deleteLabel` prop to provide an accessible label for the delete button.
- Replaced the icon used by deletable `Chip`.

## Examples

### Outlined

::example{src="mui/Chip.outlined"}

### Clickable

::example{src="mui/Chip.clickable"}

### Deletable

::example{src="mui/Chip.deletable"}

### Sizes

- **Small:** Use in compact interfaces where space is limited.
- **Medium:** Default size, suitable for most use cases.
