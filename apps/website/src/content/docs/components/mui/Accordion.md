## Use cases

## StrataKit MUI modifications

- You are not required to attribute `<AccordionSummary>` with `aria-controls`.
- Removed [`role="region"`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/region_role) semantics. The **Accordion** no longer creates a region landmark.

## Examples

### Expanded

Disclose any **Accordion's** content by default using the `defaultExpanded` prop. Alternatively, use `expanded` and `onChange` props to control the expanded state.

::example{src="mui/Accordion.expanded"}

### Variants

- **Elevation:** Default accordion styling. Use in tight spaces, such as side panels or widgets, where the context provides an outline already.
- **Outlined:** Adds a border around the accordion. Use in open layouts where you want to define the accordion's boundaries.

::example{src="mui/Accordion.variants"}

| Use case      | Elevation | Outlined |
| ------------- | --------- | -------- |
| Settings page | ❌        | ✅       |
| Widget        | ✅        | ❌       |

### Marker positioning

Use custom CSS to position the marker.

::example{src="mui/Accordion.marker-left"}

### Multiple Accordions

Multiple adjacent **Accordions** make a set. To make this set programmatically determinable and enumerable, use ARIA list semantics. Each individual `<Accordion>` must take `role="listitem"` and the set must belong to an element with `role="list"`.

**Accordions** commonly represent major sections of a page and are rendered with an [`<h3>` heading element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/Heading_Elements) by default. Use the `component` prop of the [`heading` slot props](https://mui.com/material-ui/api/accordion/#slots) to change the heading level.

::example{src="mui/Accordion.multiple"}

:::caution[Heading levels]

It's important you use an [appropriate heading level](https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/how-to-accessible-heading-structure/) for each **Accordion**. Since **Accordions** can only represent one level of data (see [**Use cases**](#use-cases)), each **Accordion** in a set must take the _same_ heading level.

- Title of page (`h1` heading)
  - **Accordion** 1 (`h2` heading)
  - **Accordion** 2 (`h2` heading)
  - **Accordion** 3 (`h2` heading)
  - **Accordion** 4 (`h2` heading)

:::

### Decorations

Decorate the `AccordionSummary` with an [**Icon**](/components/icon).

::example{src="mui/Accordion.decoration"}

### AccordionActions

Use the `AccordionActions` component to display actions related to the content of the **Accordion**.

::example{src="mui/Accordion.actions"}

## ✅ Do

- Use **Accordion** to tidy away long sections of content, to be later disclosed.
- Adopt the correct heading level for the **Accordion's** position in the document structure. The heading component can be [changed in the `slotProps`](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-accordion/#changing-heading-level).

## 🚫 Don't

- Don't nest **Accordions** inside one another.
- Don't use different heading levels for **Accordion** items in the same set. Since **Accordions** cannot be nested, they are at the same level in the document hierarchy.
- Don't close an **Accordion** when another **Accordion** is opened. Exclusive **Accordions** create [accessibility and usability issues](https://yatil.net/blog/exclusive-accordions).
- Don't place interactive elements inside an `AccordionSummary`.
